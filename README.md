# 🌐 Socialyze – A Django-Based Social Media Platform(Social + Energize)

Socialyze is a full-stack **social media web application** built using **Django**.  
It allows users to connect, share posts, follow/unfollow others, like posts, comment, and search profiles or content — similar to modern social networking platforms.

This project was developed to strengthen my **backend development skills**, understand **real-world social media features**, and implement **clean Django architecture**.
